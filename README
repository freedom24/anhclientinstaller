SWG:ANH Client Installer
------------------------

The SWG:ANH Client Installer uses the [NSIS scripting language][1] to create an 
easy-to-use method of installation for the SWG:ANH Client.

Compiling
---------

To compile the client installer the base NSIS package needs to be installed 
along with the following plugins:

[MD5dll][2]

Once downloaded copy the md5dll/ANSI/md5dll.dll file to your NSIS/plugins
directory (usually found within Program Files).

[Inetc][3]

Once downloaded copy the contents of the zip file to your NSIS directory 
(usually found within Program Files).

Obtain the client executables and dependencies and place them within the
client_files directory. Right click on the clientinstaller.nsi file and choose
Compile NSIS Script (Choose Compressor) option, then select the LZMA (solid)
compression and hit OK.
